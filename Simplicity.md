This Wiki page contains information about how team implemented Extreme Programming(XP) value Simplicity during each week.

### Simplicity according to Extreme Programming (XP)
Simplicity is one of the core values of Extreme Programming. It focuses on-
* Using the simplest possible design to get the job done. 
* Delivering the simplest functionality that meets business needs. 
* Designing the simplest software that supports the needed functionality. 
* Building for today and not for tomorrow. 
* Writing code that is easy to read, understand, maintain and modify. 

## Week-1
Following the simplicity principle, my approach towards the project should be to make the whole development and integration process simple. Like before developing any functionality, I will gather all requirements and then will choose the most simple approach to develop it. Try to avoid additional functionalities that are not needed. In this way, we will minimize any unnecessary extra effort of development and testing. 
In the first week of our project, we need to finalize the game topic, and decide upon all the levels and characters of the game. I have gone through all probable features as mentioned in document, and then I sorted them based on simplicity. After that I explained those topics and probable challenges to the team.

## Week-2
This week, we have started building the base for level 1 of the game. We first need to build the level background and decide how individual objects would work together. And I suggested that we should focus on the basic features for now and try to keep it as simple as possible for level 1 and later on if required we can add on more features to further levels. I have also given small session on how to approach the proposed design of the level. We completed the first level in this week with difficulty level being minimum.
