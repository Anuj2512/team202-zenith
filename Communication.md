### What does Communication mean in Extreme Programming(XP)?

* Extreme programming techniques can be viewed as methods for rapidly building and disseminating institutional knowledge among members of a development team. 

* The goal is to give all developers a shared view of the system which matches the view held by the users of the system.

* To this end, extreme programming favors simple designs, common metaphors, collaboration of users and programmers, frequent verbal communication, and feedback.
