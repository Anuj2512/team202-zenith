### What does Communication mean in Extreme Programming(XP)?

* Extreme programming techniques can be viewed as methods for rapidly building and disseminating institutional knowledge among members of a development team. 

* The goal is to give all developers a shared view of the system which matches the view held by the users of the system.

* To this end, extreme programming favors simple designs, common metaphors, collaboration of users and programmers, frequent verbal communication, and feedback.

## Week 1

* In first week we were new to each other and communication at first is very important. We had two team meeting on Saturday and Monday to discuss about how we are going to build the software and how we are dividing the work. 
* During first week everyone was involved in the team meeting and was very enthusiastic about the product we are developing. Everyone shared their views on how we should approach and what technologies we should use to get the best possible output.
