This Wiki page contains information about how team implemented XP Core Value, **Feedback** during each week.

In Extreme Programming, feedback can be of various forms: system and team. None of the team members "own" any code and hence, feedback on the other person's code is encouraged. System feedback can be obtained through testing the code and thereby, making the required changes to satisfy the output desired.

**Week 1**

* This week involved deciding on the vitals of the application which include different technologies, platform and programming languages to be used. Positive feedback about the gaming platform to be used led to a good and firm decision making process, providing clarity of thought to each team member. 

* The entire team pooled in their knowledge of the matter and gave in their invaluable suggestions and adapted any new changes based on the team's feedback.

* In the two meetings we had, extensive discussion took place about the game, the story behind the game, characters, worlds.


**Week 2**

* Each person brought onto the table the different stories or use cases of their domain and the understanding of their matter to which the other team members then added the extra input.


**Week 3**

* This week, the team was upto the task of resolving the inter-class dependencies. Each of the domain is dependent on the domain of the other team member. Utmost attention to detail was given to the functionalities that would be dependent on the other team member. 

* Positive feedback was delivered and accepted when it came to resolving the above mentioned. Moreover, changes were adopted according to the views of the others as well after the consensus of the entire team. This brought about a positive impact in aggregating the entire project.
