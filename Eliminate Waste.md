This Wiki page contains information about how team implemented LEAN value **Eliminate Waste** during each week.

### What is Eliminate Waste?
It is a core principle of LEAN which provides guidelines to remove waste during software development. A feature, functionality, process step is considered as a waste if it doesn't add up as a value to a customer. It is considered as an opposite of value. When a waste is identified, it should be removed from the system, product or process.

## Week-1
* As this was the first week of the project, we did not have any code or feature related issues where we can apply this principle.
* While discussing the overall project architecture and technologies, we tried to eliminate the waste which is created by re-learning. Meaning, not using the knowledge that is available within team members.
* Based on the experience and knowledge, each team member shred information about the greenfoot samples which can be used to develop the game so that a team member doesn't waste time which information is already been known by other teammate.

## Week-2
* This week we have tried to eliminate the waste which is generally created by the extra features. This type of waste is created by providing more than what is needed or asked for.
* As we were discussing the functionalities of the FastFood game, each team member came up with the different features to be added to the game. Some of those features were not needed to get the game work. Those were the extra features.
* Mutually, we agreed upon such features and decided to prepare the list of only basic and necessary features for individual's domain so that we don't complicate the development and prioritize tasks.

## Week-3
* This week we tried to eliminate the waste which is generally created by partially done work. One of the possible reasons of this type of waste is improper dependencies.
* As we have started development of the game from this week for all the levels, there are objects for which are dependent on the other objects.
* During this meeting, we identified several possible dependencies for some features. We decided to develop game in such a way that it doesn't create wait time for the dependent object. We will try to do tasks in parallel as much as possible.

## Week-4
* This week we tried to eliminate the waste which is generally created by the Hand-offs. Meaning passing the work from one person to other person after completing first person's work.
* During last week, we identified some methods which are possible dependencies. In this week, we implemented and documented these methods so that other team members who are waiting for it can use these methods for their development.
* Since, different methods have to be developed by the respective member avoiding hand-offs was impossible. We tried to maintain the Scrum board appropriately so that it helped to reduce the hand-off time.
